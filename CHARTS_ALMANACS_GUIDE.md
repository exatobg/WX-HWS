# HOW TO USE THE WEEWX ARCHIVE DATABASE TO GENERATE THE POP-UP CanvasJS CHARTS AND ALMANACS.

* Please familiarise yourself with the location of your WeeWX system files including your bin/user folder, skins folder and weewx.conf file. If you are unsure where to find these, please refer to the installation process here: - http://www.weewx.com/docs/ which shows various WeeWX installation scenarios.

* Open the weewx.conf file and find the '[StdReport]' section, then scroll down to the individual reports section and add this additional report: -

(copy and paste)
	   
	[[w34skinReport]]
        # The w34skinReport uses the 'w34skin' skin, which contains the
        # templates for the WX-HWS charts.
        skin = w34skin
        enable = true

* In the download you will find a folder called 'copy_folder_inside_into_skins_folder'. Inside is a folder called 'w34skin'. Copy or move the w34skin folder and its contents into your skins folder. You will need to edit the skin.conf file in this folder to insert your own path to the folder in which the template is installed. Eg /[YOUR_OWN_PATH]/mbcharts might typically be /var/www/html/pws/.

* You will also find a folder called 'copy_files_inside_to_user_folder'. Copy the files inside, stats.py and lastrain.py, into your weewx/bin/user folder.

# IMPORTANT

* Once complete and everyting is saved, please restart weeWX.
