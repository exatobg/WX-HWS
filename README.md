# Home Weather Station weather website template for WeeWX

This repository contains the current WeeWX version of Brian Underdown's Home Weather Station weather website template set. Brian's main website is https://weather34.com/homeweatherstation/index.html In January, 2019, Brian asked others to distribute/maintain his code. 

This version requires WeeWX software with the CRT extension to denerate data feeds for the conditions from your personal weather station. WeeWX is available at http://weewx.com

This version is designed explicitly to harness the powerful WeeWX database to generate the weather data charts and statistical data. It is built on the current MB-UB40-RRW which is now maintained by Lightmaster (Meteobridge-Weather34-Template). A key metric for this project is to maintain design, functional and performance parity with the MB-UB40 parent. Although not an absolute guarantee, the aim is to update WX-HWS within 24 hours of the parent being updated.

If you are happy to use Weather Underground as a source of data for chart generation you are strongly recommended to use the Ken True CU-HWS version (https://github.com/ktrue/CU-HWS) as your first choice which can be configured out-of-the-box to be used with WeeWX.

# What's New in this Version WX-HWS-UB40-RRW

Built on the current Meteobridge Version MB-UB40-RRW giving an identical experience.

Latest design features.

New w34 skin

Harnesses the power of the WeeWX database to generate graphs and statiscal data.

New style pop-up weather almanacs.

Introduces the concept of a WeeWX-api.

Meteobridge to WeeWX variable look-up table.

New addition charts.

New addition wind map.

New addition pop-up window links now visible in phone mode.

Auto adjusting pop-up windows for better viewing experience on smart phones and smaller tablet devices.

Enhanced chart freatures.

Dark or light chart colour theme.

Choice of 24hr 12hr station main clock.

# Important  for those using Weather Underground for chart data, unfortunately this is no longer supported. This is not a template issue, the issue lies with Weather Underground and it looks like they may have discontinued this facility. If it returns in some form it may be possible to use again but it will have to be a tried and tested feature of Weather Underground before re-introducing it into the template.

# Setup

Follow the instructions in the 'installation guide' (INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md) to install the template.
Browse to http://your.website/easywxsetup.php
There is no initial password when the page prompts the first time -- just press LOGIN to enter the page.
IMPORTANT set a password in the screen for future use -- your browser can remember it. This will make future updates    reasonably secure so only you can do the updates to the configuration.
Make setting entries in the easyweathersetup.php page and SAVE. The next time you run it, use the password you set in the step above.
Repeat running easywxsetup.php until the main screen appears as you like it.

# Diagnostics

A new utility diags.php was added to the distribution. It is useful for checking the installation of the WX-HWS template and showing (safely) the current settings.php/settings1.php file contents for debugging. Note: the entries for $password, $db_user, $db_pass are replaced with '********' to avoid unwanted disclosure of private information.

    run diags.php?show=info on your website to show the key info about the WX-HWS installation and required PHP function status
    run diags.php?show=settings on your website to safely show the current settings.php and settings1.php contents

Apart from Brian Underdown without him, this template would never exist, I would aslo like to acknowledge the following people: -

Ken True for sharing files and who makes my job of maintaining the weeWX version so much easier.

Thomas Sosio for his invaluable contribution in producing the Meteobridge lookup code to translate WeeWX database output.

David Marshall for contributing technical knowledge and solutions to create the wxchart .tmpl files and alternative solutions for weather alerts.

Lightmaster who now maintains the parent Meteobridge-Weather34-Template.

Taylormia for contributing his excellent setup example for instances where weeWX and server/template are remote to each other.

Gary Portellas for a helpful suggestion to further simplify the installation process.

All those unamed people who have helped me with testing updates
